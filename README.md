# quick2048

This is a project that I made in december of 2017 after taking a
number of higher level computer science classes. My intention was to
see how quickly I could do the introduction level computer science
final project using what I knew C++.

After working on the project for 1.5 hours I finished all the 
features required for the project as well as the extra credit
features - which just included a working board and a score. Then I
starting adding ridiculous features because I wanted to see how
far I could take the assignment. And then I took it too far.
